<p>Myefox Quality Control From Sourcing to Delivery</p>
<br />
<p>ver wonder what your newly-purchased digital camera went through to arrive safely at your doorstep?

<p><strong>Sourcing Your Products</strong></p>
<p>While you're sitting in the comfort of your own office or home to browsing on Myefox 's huge range of products, we're already busy selecting the best products at the best prices, all with you, the customer, in mind. With offices in Shenzhen and Beijing, Myefox works with the best and most trusted manufacturers throughout China, selected for quality of their products, reputation, reliability, and whether they share our passion for serving customers like you.</p>
<p>After a rigorous inspection and vetting process of the products we know shoppers are interested in, we make them available to you at unbeatable prices, since we source them straight from the manufacturer. Myefox is also plugged into the market news wires for hot new lines, the latest designs, and the best quality products. The upshot is that shoppers can find most anything at Myefox, from consumer electronics and high-end tech products, to clothing, wedding apparel, and crafts.</p>
<br />
<p><strong>Processing Your Product Order</strong></p>
<p>Upon clicking "Complete Order," your friends at Myefox spring into action and immediately begin processing your order. One employee reviews the details of your order, checking for anything that might delay processing, while another speeds off to pull the inventory from our shelves. Meanwhile, an email confirmation of your order will have already arrived in your inbox. </p>
<br />
<p><strong>Testing Your Products</strong></p>
<p>Even though our suppliers are all trusted manufacturers of quality items, we don’t take any chances with your specific order. All products go through an exhaustive Q.C. procedure:</p>
<p>

<td style="margin-top:20px; ">
Everything is first routed to our International Distribution Center where a highly-trained inspection team evaluates your products based on strict protocols and inspection requirements. And our requirements are high: only 80 percent of initially selected products are given our stamp of approval at this stage 
<br />
Did we get your order right? Before we begin packing, we do a thorough check to match orders correctly.
Our own Quality Control team then gives your product another inspection, inside and out, following strict protocols and requirements.
If the product meets our standards, we give it our stamp of approval. It's now ready to be shipped off to you!

<br />
<strong>Packing Your Products</strong>
<br />
<br />
<br />
Myefox 's packaging and delivery team runs like clockwork, even if we do say so ourselves. Items are always carefully inspected for any manufacturing and design defects before they're shipped off to ensure that the item you fell in love with online is the item you receive from our courier. Our team members check order slips with the original online purchase confirmation, and then review the product pulled from the shelf to make sure it checks out with the product listed.

</p>
<p>Then, and only then, does the team move on to packaging the order, doubling-up (and often more) on the bubble wrap and tape. Next, it's out the door in safe hands with our trusted and verified couriers. </p>
<br />
<p><strong>Tracking Your Products</strong></p>
<p>Once your product leaves our doors, we keep on tracking it until it reaches yours. Myefox 's customer service team is always working behind the scenes to address your every need and query. We track your shipments real-time, and are available at your convenience to answer any questions, whether by email, live chat, or over the phone. No matter the issue, we're always here to serve you.</p>
