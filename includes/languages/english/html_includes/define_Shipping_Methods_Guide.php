<p><strong>Estimate Delivery Time</strong></p>
<p>You can choose the shipping method you want on the <strong>Billing, Shipping, and Review</strong> page during the Checkout process. There are three main shipping methods to choose from:</p>
<p><strong>Expedited Shipping</strong></p>
<p>This shipping method is the fastest available. Delivery times are between 3 - 5 days to all major destinations. Shipping costs vary with item, but all orders that use expedited shipping will receive a 36% discount on shipping costs.</p>
<p><strong>Standard Shipping</strong></p>
<p>Standard shipping takes a bit longer than expedited shipping but costs less. Delivery times are between 6 - 8 days to all major destinations. Shipping costs vary with item, but all orders that use standard shipping will receive a 26% discount on shipping costs.</p>
<p>Super Saver Shipping</p>
<p>Delivery times are between 15 - 30 days for all major destinations. Although the delivery time is much longer, shipping costs are much lower when this option is chosen. Order tracking may not always be available with Super Saver Shipping. Please take this into consideration when choosing this option.</p>
<p><strong>The above delivery estimates do not include order processing time. See estimate total delivery time for more details.</strong></p>
<p>Some of our items also have extra savings on shipping. Look out for following stickers on our products:</p>

<p><strong>Calculate Shipping Costs</strong></p>
<p>Shipping costs are calculated individually for each order based on the number and weight of items in your order, as well as the shipping method chosen. For this reason, the price displayed on product information pages does not include shipping.</p>
<p>To estimate shipping cost for any product item or combination of items:</p>
<p>l'On the item's product information page, click the Add to Cart button  <img src="http://www.myefox.com/images/s/image0014.gif" /> . You will be then taken to your Shopping Cart page.</p>
<p>l'View the total shipping costs for the items in your cart under Estimate Shipping Costs at the bottom of the page.</p>
<p>l  You can also access your Shopping Cart at any time by clicking the Cart  <img src="http://www.myefox.com/images/s/image0015.jpg" />  at the top of every page on Myefox.com.</p>
<p>Note: Adding an item to your shopping cart puts you under no obligation to order. If after viewing estimated shipping costs you no longer wish to order an item, simply click Delete<img src="http://www.myefox.com/images/s/image0016.png" />   next to the item name in your shopping cart to remove it.</p>
<br />

<br />
<p><strong>Estimate Total Delivery Time</strong></p>
<p>Before your order is shipped, Myefox has to process your order and put all your items through its strict quality control tests. Because of this, Total Delivery Time is different to shipping time alone.</p>
<p><strong>Total Delivery Time = Processing Time  Shipping Time</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center; "><img src="http://www.myefox.com/images/s/image0017.jpg" /></p>
<p>As we have such a wide range of products, processing time differs from category to category. Please click here to see an estimate of Total Delivery Time about your order. </p>
